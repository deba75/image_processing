# Image Processing

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook for performing image processing using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy. 


## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Google Colab
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy

---

## 📁 Files

- `lab2.ipynb` – Main Colab notebook implementing the image negative logic.
- `sample_image.jpg` *(optional)* – You can add a sample image for demonstration.

---

## 🖼️ Output Description

The notebook:
1. Loads a grayscale image using OpenCV
2. Applies image negative transformation using a `for` loop
3. Displays the original and negative image side-by-side

---

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Mount Google Drive (if using external images):
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')

3. Set your image path (e.g., /content/drive/MyDrive/image.jpg)

4. Run all cells
